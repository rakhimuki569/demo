    <h1>What is jQuery</h1>
    <div>
        <p>jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library.</p>
        <p>A library containing a set of functions (reusable functions) created using JavaScript.</p>
        <p>jQuery is a cross-platform JavaScript library designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML. 
            It is free, open-source software using the permissive MIT License.</p>
            
       
    </div>
    <h1>Why jQuery</h1>
    <div>
        <p>jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish and 
            wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.</p>
        <p>jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation. 
            Also, from CSS to ex. CSS manipulation, 
            Effects, and animations</p>
        <p>JQuery functions are completely browser independent.</p>
        <P>jQuery is not a language, but it is a well written JavaScript code. As quoted on official jQuery website,
             "it is a fast and concise JavaScript Library that simplifies HTML document traversing, event handling, animating, 
            and Ajax interactions for rapid web development"</P>

        <h1>What is jQuery?</h1>
        <p>jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library.
            The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.</p>
        <p>jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, 
            and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.
            jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM 
            manipulation.</p>
        <p>The jQuery library contains the following features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML/DOM manipulation</li>
            <li>CSS manipulation</li>
            <li>HTML event methods</li>
            <li>Effects and animations</li>
            <li>AJAX</li>
            <li>Utilities</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Tip: In addition, jQuery has plugins for almost any task out there.</p>
        <p>Adding jQuery to Your Web Pages
            There are several ways to start using jQuery on your web site. You can:</p>
        <p>Download the jQuery library from jQuery.com<br>
            Include jQuery from a CDN, like Google<br>
            Downloading jQuery<br>
            There are two versions of jQuery available for downloading:</p>
    </div>

<div>
    <p>Production version - this is for your live website because it has been minified and compressed</p>
    <p>Development version - this is for testing and development (uncompressed and readable code)</p>
    <p>Both versions can be downloaded from jQuery.com.</p>
    <p>jQuery CDN</p>
    <p>If you don't want to download and host jQuery yourself, you can include it from a CDN (Content Delivery Network).

        Both Google and Microsoft host jQuery.
        
        One big advantage of using the hosted jQuery from Google or Microsoft:
        
        Many users already have downloaded jQuery from Google or Microsoft when visiting another site.
         As a result, it will be loaded from cache when they visit your site, which leads to faster loading time.
         Also, most CDN's will make sure that once a user requests a file from it, 
         it will be served from the server closest to them, which also leads to faster loading time.</p>
