   The oncopy event occurs when the user copies the content of an element.

 Tip: The oncopy event also occurs when the user copies an element, for example, an image,
  created with the img element.

 The onpaste event occurs when the user pastes some content in an element.

 Note: Although the onpaste event is supported by all HTML elements, it is not actually 
 possible to paste some content in, for example, a p element, UNLESS the element has set contenteditable to "true"
  (See "More Examples" below).
