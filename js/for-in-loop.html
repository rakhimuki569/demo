//     what is Enumerable in javascript? 
//     The for/in statement loops through the properties of an object.
//      The block of code inside the loop will be executed once for each property.
// What enumerable in Javascript means
// It simply means that the property will show up if you iterate over the object using for..inloop or Object.keys. 
// This means we can iterate over object keys if keys are set to enumerable (By default enumerable)
