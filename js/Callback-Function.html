//     A callback is a function that is to be executed after another function has finished executing — 
//     hence the name ‘call back’.

// Any function that is passed as an argument is called a callback function.

// Why do we need Callbacks?

// For one very important reason — JavaScript is an event-driven language. 
// This means that instead of waiting for a response before moving on, 
// JavaScript will keep executing while listening for other events.

// Callbacks are a way to make sure a certain code doesn’t execute until another code has already finished execution



// function funA(){
//     console.log("funA");

// }
// function funb(){
//     console.log("funb");

// }
// funA();
// funb();


/// i want to hold funA function

function funA(){
    setTimeout(function(){
        console.log("funA");

    },3000)
   
}
function funb(){
    console.log("funb");

}
funA();
