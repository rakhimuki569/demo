    <h1>Constructor in typescript </h1>
    <p>Constructors − Responsible for allocating memory for the objects of the class. A constructor is a special function of the class that is responsible for initializing the variables of the class. TypeScript defines a constructor using the constructor keyword.
         A constructor is a function and hence can be parameterized.</p>
    <p>The this keyword refers to the current instance of the class. Here, the parameter name and the name of the class’s field are the same. Hence to avoid ambiguity,
         the class’s field is prefixed with this keyword.</p>

            Constructor in TypeScript

            Constructors are identified with keyword "constructor". A Constructor is a special type of method of a class and it will be automatically invoked when an instance of the class is created. A class may contain at least one constructor declaration. If a class has no constructor, a constructor is provided automatically. A class can have any number of constructors. When you are using the attribute public or private with constructor parameters, a field is automatically created, which is assigned the value.
