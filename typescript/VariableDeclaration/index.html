        <h2>How to declare a variable in typescript</h2>
        <p>A variable, by definition, is “a named space in the memory” that stores values. In other words, it acts as a container for values in a program. TypeScript variables must follow the JavaScript naming rules −</p>
        <p>Variable names can contain alphabets and numeric digits.</p>
        <p>They cannot contain spaces and special characters, except the underscore (_) and the dollar ($) sign.

            Variable names cannot begin with a digit.
            
            A variable must be declared before it is used. Use the var keyword to declare variables</p>
        <p>
            When you declare a variable, you have four options −

Declare its type and value in one statement.

Declare Type
Declare its type but no value. In this case, the variable will be set to undefine.

Undefined
Declare its value but no type. The variable type will be set to any.

Any
Declare neither value not type. In this case, the data type of the variable will be any and will be initialized to undefined.

Any and Undefined
