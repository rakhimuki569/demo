        <h1>Typescript type definitions. Basic Types
            Introduction</h1>
        <p>For programs to be useful, we need to be able to work with some of the simplest units of data: numbers, strings, structures, boolean values, and the like. In TypeScript, we support much the same types as you would expect in JavaScript, with a convenient enumeration type thrown in to help things along.</p>
        <pre>Boolean
            The most basic datatype is the simple true/false value, which JavaScript and TypeScript call a boolean value.
            
            let isDone: boolean = false;
            Number
            As in JavaScript, all numbers in TypeScript are floating point values. These floating point numbers get the type number. In addition to hexadecimal and decimal literals, TypeScript also supports binary and octal literals introduced in ECMAScript 2015.
            
            let decimal: number = 6;
            let hex: number = 0xf00d;
            let binary: number = 0b1010;
            let octal: number = 0o744;
            String
            Another fundamental part of creating programs in JavaScript for webpages and servers alike is working with textual data. As in other languages, we use the type string to refer to these textual datatypes. Just like JavaScript, TypeScript also uses double quotes (") or single quotes (') to surround string data.
            
            let color: string = "blue";
            color = 'red';
            
            Array
            TypeScript, like JavaScript, allows you to work with arrays of values. Array types can be written in one of two ways. In the first, you use the type of the elements followed by [] to denote an array of that element type:
            
            let list: number[] = [1, 2, 3];
            
            Enum
            A helpful addition to the standard set of datatypes from JavaScript is the enum. As in languages like C#, an enum is a way of giving more friendly names to sets of numeric values.
            
            enum Color {Red, Green, Blue}
            let c: Color = Color.Green;
            
            Any
            We may need to describe the type of variables that we do not know when we are writing an application. These values may come from dynamic content, e.g. from the user or a 3rd party library. In these cases, we want to opt-out of type-checking and let the values pass through compile-time checks. To do so, we label these with the any type:
            
            let notSure: any = 4;
            notSure = "maybe a string instead";
            notSure = false; // okay, definitely a boolean
            The any type is a powerful way to work with existing JavaScript, allowing you to gradually opt-in and opt-out of type-checking during compilation. You might expect Object to play a similar role, as it does in other languages. But variables of type Object only allow you to assign any value to them - you canâ€™t call arbitrary methods on them, even ones that actually exist:
