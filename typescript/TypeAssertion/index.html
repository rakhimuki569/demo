    <h1>TypeScript Type Assertion</h1>
    <div>
        <h2></h2>
        <p>TypeScript allows you to override its inferred and analyzed view of types in any way you want to. This is done by a mechanism called "type assertion". TypeScript's type assertion is purely you telling the compiler that you know about the types better than it does, and that it should not second guess you.</p>
        <p>A common use case for type assertion is when you are porting over code from JavaScript to TypeScript. </p>
        <p>Type Assertion vs. Casting
            The reason why it's not called "type casting" is that casting generally implies some sort of runtime support. However type assertions are purely a compile-time construct and a way for you to provide hints to the compiler on how you want your code to be analyzed.</p>
