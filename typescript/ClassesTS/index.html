    <h1>What is Class in Typescript</h1>
    <p>TypeScript is object-oriented JavaScript. TypeScript supports object-oriented programming features like classes, interfaces, etc. A class in terms of OOP is a blueprint for creating objects. A class encapsulates data for the object. Typescript gives built-in support for this concept called class.
         JavaScript ES5 or earlier didn’t support classes. Typescript gets this feature from ES6.</p>
    <div>
        <h2>Creating classes</h2>
        <pre>
            Use the class keyword to declare a class in TypeScript. The syntax for the same is given below −

Syntax
class class_name { 
   //class scope 
}
The class keyword is followed by the class name. The rules for identifiers must be considered while naming a class.

A class definition can include the following −

Fields − A field is any variable declared in a class. Fields represent data pertaining to objects

Constructors − Responsible for allocating memory for the objects of the class

Functions − Functions represent actions an object can take. They are also at times referred to as methods

These components put together are termed as the data members of the class.

Consider a class Person in typescript.

class Person {
}
On compiling, it will generate following JavaScript code.

Generated by typescript 1.8.10
var Person = (function () {
   function Person() {
   }
   return Person;
}());
